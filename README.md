# Rss feed extractor

Extracts youtube rss feeds urls from the opml file to be used in rss mix.  
Turn 100 rss feeds into 1 with the help of [rss mix](http://rssmix.com/).
# Y THO?  
Some rss feed readers allow for a maximum of 100 subscriptions if you don't pay.  
Considering that I have more than 100 Youtube subscriptions and I hate paying when I can avoid it this script was a simple decision.  
## Getting started  
* In order to run the script you need to install all the required prerequisites.   
* Go to https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager and grab the file.  
* Change the 'file' variable to point to 'subscription_manager' file.
